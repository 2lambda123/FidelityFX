# FidelityFX

FidelityFX is out series of optimized, shader-based features aimed at improving rendering quality and performance.

These features are designed to be easy to integrate, we ship HLSL and/or GLSL versions of the effects to allow you to target any API.

## Contrast Adaptive Sharpening (CAS)
CAS is a low overhead adaptive sharpening algorithm with optional up-sampling.
